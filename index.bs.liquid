Abstract: This document specifies the generic data model to be used when publishing linked data in the heritage network. 
    The model enables dataset consumers, including software developers building data-consuming applications,
    to use, understand and combine datasets from multiple sources,
    thus fulfilling the promise of linked data.

Introduction {#intro}
===============

Goal {#goal}
---

This document prescribes the SCHEMA-AP-NDE [=generic data model=] to be used when publishing linked data in the Dutch heritage network (NDE).
The model consists of a minimal set of classes and properties.
It is based on:

- the current state of datasets in the heritage network,
    as observed in the [Dataset Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/netwerk-digitaal-erfgoed/dataset-knowledge-graph),
    particularly its <a href="https://triplestore.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/sparql?savedQueryName=Property%20partitions%20per%20class&owner=admin">property partitions analysis</a>;
- the needs of service platform builders for understanding, processing and presenting data, especially across datasets and publishers.

By adhering to this model, [[NDE-DATASETS#publisher|dataset publishers]] ensure that their data can be:

1. discovered, understood and combined with other datasets in the network;
2. used in service platforms to build applications and visualisations.

Scope {#scope}
-----

The document is restricted in four ways:

1. it applies to the Dutch heritage network (NDE), which implements the [[NDHS|National Digital Heritage Strategy]] and [[DERA|Digital Reference Heritage Architecture]];  
2. it applies to the way published data is expressed, not how it is stored or managed internally;
3. it prescribes a [=generic data model=] and leaves the use of [=domain data models=] up to [[NDE-DATASETS#publisher|dataset publishers]]; 
4. it bears upon [[NDE-DATASETS#dataset|datasets]], not their [[NDE-DATASETS#dataset-description|descriptions]]; for the latter see [[NDE-DATASETS]].

Examples {#examples}

General considerations {#general-considerations}
==========

Generic and domain data models {#generic-and-domain-data-models}
---

The purpose of generic data models is to integrate data in the heritage network and make it more visible.
Domain models are usually more richly populated and provide consumers with more possibilities for further processing,
for example in service platforms.

This document is limited to a set of classes and properties that together form the [=generic data model=].
For most datasets, the generic data model expresses only a subset of data properties that are available.
This document’s purpose, therefore, is not a complete and correct expression of the source data,
but an easily understandable and usable one.

If done well, the generic data invites consumers to explore the data in more depth using the [=domain data models=].
So to facilitate further exploration, publishers *MAY* use [=domain data models=] of their choosing alongside the generic data model.
Examples are:

- <a href="https://cidoc-crm.org">CIDOC-CRM</a> and its derivative [Linked Art](https://linked.art/model/) for museum collections and catalogues;
- [RiC-O](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O) for archives;
- [PiCo](https://personsincontext.org) for biographical data;
- <a href="https://www.rdaregistry.info/Elements/">RDA</a> for libraries.

<pre class=include-raw>
path: assets/data-models.svg
</pre>

Vocabulary {#vocabulary}
---

The generic data model presented in this document is designed as a [[!SCHEMA-ORG]] application profile.
Schema.org is a widely adopted cross-domain metadata standard.
It is, therefore, well-suited for the heritage network, which spans datasets from the library, archive, museum and other domains.

The Schema.org website <a href="https://schema.org/docs/faq.html#19">considers</a> “both ‘https://schema.org’ and 'http://schema.org' (…) fine”.
However, JSON-LD's `"@context": "https://schema.org/"` resolves all terms to `http://schema.org/` IRIs,
meaning tools that process JSON-LD produce `http://` namespace URIs regardless of the scheme used in the context.

To avoid mixed namespaces and enable interoperability across serialisation formats,
[[NDE-DATASETS#publisher|publishers]] *SHOULD* use the `http://schema.org/` namespace.
Both `http://schema.org/` and `https://schema.org/` *MUST* be accepted by consumers.

Language {#language}
----------

For all name and description values, their language *MUST* be specified.
The language *MUST* be expressed as a well-formed language tag according to [[!BCP47]], such as ‘nl’ (language only) or ‘nl-NL’ (including region).

<div class="example">
    Specifying the language of the `name` property:

    <pre highlight=json-ld line-numbers line-highlight="5-14">
        {
          "@context": "http://schema.org",
          "@id": "https://n2t.net/ark:/123456/1",
          "@type": "CreativeWork",
          "name": [
            {
              "@language": "nl",
              "@value": "De Sterrennacht"
            },
            {
              "@language": "en",
              "@value": "The Starry Night"
            }
          ]
        }
    </pre>
</div>

Even if only one language is available, the language *MUST* be specified.

<div class="example">
    Specify the language property even for a single value:

    <pre highlight=json-ld line-numbers line-highlight="3-6">
        {
          "@context": "http://schema.org",
          "name": {
            "@language": "nl",
            "@value": "De Sterrennacht"
          }
        }
    </pre>
</div>

Each language *MUST* occur only once, so only a single value per language is allowed.

<div class="example">
    ❌ Do not specify the same language twice:

    <pre highlight=json-ld line-numbers line-highlight="5,9">
        {
          "@context": "http://schema.org",
          "name": [
            {
              "@language": "en",
              "@value": "The Starry Night"
            },
            {
              "@language": "en",
              "@value": "Repeated English name while only one is allowed"
            }
          ]
        }
    </pre>
</div>

Reference terms {#reference-terms}
---

When referencing [=terms=], publishers *MUST* use the term’s URI.

The term *MUST* be typed as [DefinedTerm](https://schema.org/DefinedTerm)
to indicate to consumers that a formal definition is being referenced.

Terms *MUST* be dereferenceable, which means that consumers can retrieve the term’s definition either: 

- through the [Network of Terms](https://termennetwerk.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/en/lookup);
- by directly resolving its URI.

Publishers *SHOULD* add the term’s name in any language(s) they know about for readability:

<div class="example">
    Use the term’s URI and add its name:

    <pre highlight=json-ld line-numbers line-highlight="5-12">
        {
          "@context": "http://schema.org",
          "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q45585",
          "@type": "CreativeWork",
          "creator": {
            "@id": "https://data.rkd.nl/artists/32439",
            "@type": ["DefinedTerm", "Person"],
            "name": {
              "@language": "nl",
              "@value": "Vincent van Gogh"
            }
          }
        }
    </pre>
</div>

In some cases, an additional Schema.org type *MUST* be added to produce valid Schema.org syntax. For locations this
*MUST* be [Place](https://schema.org/Place); in other cases [URL](https://schema.org/URL) *MUST* be used.

<div class="example">
    Add type URL for valid Schema.org syntax:

    <pre highlight=json-ld line-numbers line-highlight="6">
        {
          "@context": "http://schema.org",
          "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q45585",
          "@type": "CreativeWork",
          "additionalType": {
            "@type": ["DefinedTerm", "URL"],
            "@id": "http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300404016"
          }
        }
    </pre>
</div>

Serialization {#serialization}
---

Servers *MUST* provide at least one RDF serialization format. 
Supporting multiple formats using [[RFC9110#content.negotiation|content negotiation]] is *RECOMMENDED*.

The following formats are *RECOMMENDED*:

- [[!JSON-LD]] when serving an individual resource at its URI, because of its accessibility to web platform builders;
- [[!N-QUADS]] for RDF dumps containing multiple resources, because of its efficiency.

Publication method {#publication-method}
---

### Publication levels ### {#publication-levels}

In the heritage network, SCHEMA-AP-NDE data *MUST* be available on two levels: 

1. resolvable URIs for individual resources
2. data dumps for datasets

It *MAY* additionally be available through a:

3. SPARQL endpoint.

If the generic data model is used alongside [=domain data models=], there are two methods for doing so:

- [[#combined]]
- [[#profiles]].

Publishers *MUST* support at least one of these methods.

<table class="syntax">
    <caption>
        Matrix of publications levels and methods.
    </caption>
    <thead>
        <td></td>
        <td>Combined</td>
        <td>Separate profiles</td>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Resolvable URI</td>
            <td>✅</td>
            <td>✅</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Data dump</td>
            <td>✅</td>
            <td>✅</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>SPARQL endpoint</td>
            <td>❌</td>
            <td>✅</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Combined ### {#combined}

With RDF, it’s perfectly fine to express the same data in multiple ways.
Therefore, the [=generic data model|generic=] and [=domain data models=] *MAY* coexist in the same information resource.

<div class="example">
    Combine generic (Schema.org) with domain-specific (Linked Art) modelling.    

    <pre highlight=json-ld>
        {
          "@context": {
            "schema": "http://schema.org/",
            "rdfs": "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#",
            "dcterms": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/"
          },
          "@id": "https://literatuurmuseum.nl/id/123456789",
          "@type": ["schema:CreativeWork", "schema:VisualArtwork"],
          "schema:name": "Het fluitketeltje en andere versjes",
          "rdfs:label": "Het fluitketeltje en andere versjes",
          "schema:creator": {
            "@type": "schema:Person",
            "@id": "http://data.rkd.nl/artists/8342"
          },
          "dcterms:creator": {
            "@type": "dcterms:Agent",
            "@id": "http://data.rkd.nl/artists/8342"
          }
       }
    </pre>
</div>

### Separate profiles ### {#profiles}

Alternatively, publishers *MAY* separate the generic data model by using profile-based content negotiation (see [[!DX-PROF-CONNEG]]).
To do so, publish a profile with URI `https://docs.nde.nl/schema-profile/`.

Note: While still a draft, [[!DX-PROF-CONNEG]] has already been implemented, for example by the [Rijksmuseum](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/docs/http/#http-content-negotiation).  

<div class="example">
    Expose the generic data model in its own content-negotiated profile.    

    <pre highlight=http>
        # Get the list of profiles.
        GET /resource/a?profile=alt HTTP/1.1
        
        # Server responds with a list of profiles that includes the NDE generic data model.
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/json
        
        {
            "resource": "http://example.org/resource/a",
            "profiles": [
                {
                    "token": "nde",
                    "uri": "https://docs.nde.nl/schema-profile/",
                    "media_types": ["application/ld+json", "text/turtle"]
                },
                ...
            ]
        }
    </pre>
</div>

It is then possible to request the metadata record in the generic data model using the `Accept-Profile` HTTP header:

<div class="example">
    Request the metadata record in SCHEMA-AP-NDE:    

    <pre highlight=http>
        GET /resource/a HTTP/1.1
        Accept: application/ld+json
        Accept-Profile: &lt;https://docs.nde.nl/schema-profile/>
        
        # Server responds with a SCHEMA-AP-NDE representation of the metadata record.
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/ld+json

        ...
    </pre>
</div>

Data model {#data-model-section}
==========

This section describes the classes and properties that *MUST* be used to publish [=metadata records=] in the heritage network.

Each record *MUST* be typed as one of the following classes:

- [[#CreativeWork|CreativeWork]]
- [[#Person|Person]]
- [[#Organization|Organization]]
- [[#Place|Place]].

For each of these classes, the sections below list the *REQUIRED* and *OPTIONAL* properties.

[[#MediaObject|MediaObject]] is documented as a supporting class, used through the `associatedMedia` property on [[#CreativeWork|CreativeWork]].

{% assign mainNodeShapes = nodeShapes | where: "name" %}

## Class diagram ## {#class-diagram}

<pre class='include-raw'>
path: assets/class-diagram.svg
</pre>

{% for nodeShape in mainNodeShapes %}
    ## {{ nodeShape.name }} ## {#{{ nodeShape.name }}}

    {{ nodeShape.description }}

    {% if nodeShape.name == "CreativeWork" %}
        Note: CreativeWork does not reference the Dutch legal concept ‘creatief werk’
        as used in the Auteurswet (Copyright Act of 1912) in any way.

        ### Subclasses ### {#subclasses}
        
        Publishers *SHOULD* use more fine-grained classes alongside the top-level class `CreativeWork`.
        Examples include, but are not limited to:
        
        - [Article](https://schema.org/Article) for [[#example-story|stories]];
        - [ArchiveComponent](https://schema.org/ArchiveComponent) for archival items and collections;
        - [Book](https://schema.org/Book);
        - [Manuscript](https://schema.org/Manuscript);
        - [Message](https://schema.org/Message) for letters;
        - [MusicComposition](https://schema.org/MusicComposition), [MusicRecording](https://schema.org/MusicRecording) and [MusicAlbum](https://schema.org/MusicAlbum) for musical items and collections;
        - [Painting](https://schema.org/Painting);
        - [Photograph](https://schema.org/Photograph).
        
        <div class="example">
            A painting is typed as both top-level CreativeWork and the more specific Painting:
        
            <pre highlight=json-ld>
                {
                  "@context": "http://schema.org",
                  "@id": "https://n2t.net/ark:/123456/1",
                  "@type": ["CreativeWork", "Painting"]
                }
            </pre>
        </div>
        
        Even though the superclass can be derived from its subclasses using RDF inferencing
        (in this example, CreativeWork from Painting),
        the superclass *MUST* be provided explicitly to help users understand the data.
    {% endif %}

    {% if nodeShape.nodeKind == "IRI" %}
        ### URI (required) ### {#{{ nodeShape.name }}-URI}
        
        Each [[#{{ nodeShape.name }}|{{ nodeShape.name }}]] *MUST* be identified by a [[NDE-COLLECTION-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS#persistent-uri|persistent URI]].
        Blank nodes *MUST NOT* be used.
        
        <div class="example">
            Specify the URI in the JSON-LD `@id` property:
        
            <pre highlight=json-ld line-numbers line-highlight="3">
                {
                  "@context": "http://schema.org",
                  "@id": "https://example.com/resource",
                  "@type": "{{ nodeShape.name }}"
                }
            </pre>
        </div>
    {% endif %}

    {% for property in nodeShape.property -%}
        {% assign name = property.path | replace: "schema:", "" %}
        ### {{ name }}{% if property.minCount > 0 %} (required){% endif %} ### {#{{ nodeShape.name }}-{{ name  }}}
    
        {{- property.description 
            | replace: "CreativeWork", "[[#CreativeWork|CreativeWork]]" 
            | replace: "MediaObject", "[[#MediaObject|MediaObject]]" 
            | replace: "Organization", "[[#Organization|Organization]]" 
            | replace: "Person", "[[#Person|Person]]" 
            | replace: "ISO 8601", "[[!ISO8601]]" 
        -}}
    
        {%- if property.datatype == "rdf:langString" -%}
            The value *MUST* be a [[#language|language-tagged]] string. 
        {% endif %}

        {% if property['rdfs:seeAlso'] -%}
            {% assign examples = [] | concat: property['rdfs:seeAlso'] %}

            {% for example in examples %}
                <div class="example">
                    {{ example['rdfs:label'] }}
